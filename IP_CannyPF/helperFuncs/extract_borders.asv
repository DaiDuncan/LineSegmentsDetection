% Description: From the detected edges, use moving window to count the
% edges number in the window (the edges should have a angle within the angle tolerance) and
% calculate the edges length in the window to give a rank to the index in x
% axis, from which we select the left and right border index.
%
% Inputs:
%   - edges: different edge detecters produce different types of edges.
%       for LSD: two endpoints (OpenCV)
%       for EDLines: two endpoints (OpenCV)
%       for CannyPF: edgeChains -> use the start and end points in the chain as endpoints
%       for MCMLSD: two endpoints
%       The elements in one row of `edges` is (x1, y1, x2, y2)
%   - scale (default is 4): the scale/resize size in x axis
%   - imageWidth (in pixels): the width of the original image (before resizing)
%   - windowWidth (in pixels): the width of the border (recommended: 10 ~ 40 pixels)
%   - windowStepSize (in pixels): (recommended: 1/4 of the window width)
%   - angle_expect (in rad): angle of inclination of the border (recomended: (90 degree /180*pi) rad)
%   - angle_tolerance: tolerance of the angle (recomended: (5 degree /180*pi) rad)
%   - lenth_threshold: to be determined after calculating in train dataset...
%   - number_threshold: to be determined after calculating in train dataset...
%   - prior_mandrel_percent:  the middle part to be ignored (recommended: 1/4 of the original image 
%                           -> it's better use a small number, to avoid borders being ignored)
%   - prior_mandrel_diameter: to deal with corner case, when the left border is hard to be detected
%
% Outputs:
%   - left_border_index: left border in the original image
%   - right_border_indexï¼š right border in the original image
%   - windows_features: the total number and length of valid edges in all
%   moving windows
%   - full_edges_filter_by_angle: elements in one row -> (x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., length, angle)
%   
% Preconditions: none

%% find the border index: left peak, right peak
% 1 prior knowledge: the percentage of mandrel in image ->  (1/4 ~ 1/3) -> 
% this part will be ignored, this also divide the image into 2 parts: 
% left part & right part


% 2 corner case: using prior_mandrel_diameter
% lenth_threshold, number_threshold help to determine whether it's a corner
% case or not
